# Portable MLIR Toolchain

This repository provides pre-built MLIR binaries.

## Build Scripts

If desired, you can also use our build scripts directly.
Refer to

- [`scripts/toolchain/linux/build.sh`](./scripts/toolchain/linux/build.sh) for Linux,
- [`scripts/toolchain/macos/build.sh`](./scripts/toolchain/macos/build.sh) for macOS, and
- [`scripts/toolchain/windows/build.ps1`](./scripts/toolchain/windows/build.ps1) for Windows.

The usage is detailed in the scripts.
Note that the Linux script requires Docker to be installed on the host system.
